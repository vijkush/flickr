flickr
======

A python script that allows you to download your favorite images from your flickr account.
The best available resolution for the image (based on the rights associated with that image) is downloaded.

The script also embeds the EXIF data and other metadata associated with that image into the file.

The project aims to evolve to a Flickr Favorite's Manager running as a Desktop UI to allow users to
  - classify images to be belonging to genres/styles
  - filter images from their favorites based on metadata, comments, number of likes...
  - play a slideshow of images belonging to a certain genre
  etc
